# Python - AirBnB clone (second part (0x01)) --> Web static:

## Description of the project:

This is the **second** of **seven** parts of the AirBnB clone project, which will result in a clone of the AirBnB website (front-end and back-end).
In this second part we are going to use HTML and CSS in orther to build a web static. HTML is the structure of your page, CSS is the styling of your page, the design.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

* Create simple HTML static pages
* Style guide
* Fake contents
* No Javascript
* No data loaded from anything

Below is a ``diagram showing the complete project``. In this instance we will cover the **HTML** and **CSS** of the front end (client side):
